gphoto-webui
============

My goal is to create a decent web interface through the rPi and be able to control my DSLR. I would have thought something like this already existed, but I couldn't find one with all the capabilities I was looking for.

Features (currently being implemented):
* Change settings, such as ISO, Shutter Speed and Aperture - done
* Take picture - done
* View photos on the camera - done
* Download the original file to the phone - partial
* Download a converted JPEG to the phone (from RAW) - partial
* Timelapse settings (later)

1) Install the following packages.

Install php7.1: http://www.heidislab.com/tutorials/installing-php-7-1-on-raspbian-stretch-raspberry-pi-zero-w

```
sudo apt-get install php5 php5-cli php5-json zip unzip exiv2 ufraw
```

Note: You do not need a web server. In fact, I wouldn’t recommend it for this little app because this app will need more elevated permissions than the www-data user has. Configuring the server to run a user with elevated permissions might work, but not necessary. PHP has a built in development server that will work just fine and also run as the logged on user. 

> DON'T RUN THIS ON THE PUBLIC INTERNET. THIS IS NOT INTENDED FOR THAT AND IS NOT SECURE! 

2) Install latest gphoto2 (v2.5.9+). I recommend using the gphoto2-updater script here:

https://github.com/gonzalo/gphoto2-updater

3) Download the gphoto-webui from from github. I suggest your home folder, as it will extract a gphoto-webui folder.

```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/thanhlongmuah/gphoto-webui
```

4) Start the php server. This will bind the server to port 8000 on all IP’s.

```
cd gphoto-webui/bin; ./gphoto-webui.sh
```


TO CONFIRM...

5) Point your browser to http://x.x.x.x:8000/  (x.x.x.x is the IP if your Raspberry Pi)


To make it launch on startup:
```
sudo ln -s /home/pi/gphoto-webui/bin/gphoto-webui.sh /etc/init.d/gphoto-webui.sh
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/gphoto-webui.sh /etc/rc3.d/S999gphoto-webui
sudo ln -s /etc/init.d/gphoto-webui.sh /etc/rc5.d/S999gphoto-webui
```


Enjoy!


This started out as an extension of the original gphoto-webui project, but it has become much more, including a rewrite.
